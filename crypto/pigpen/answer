FLAG: Passwords should be long, easy to remember, and difficult to guess.
The quote given in the question is a quote from Charley Brown, by a character named, "Pig Pen". This is also the name of the cipher used in the code. You can translate directly from PigPen to English. Alternatively, you can assign all of the symbols in the cipher to a given letter in English, and then treated the cipher like a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
