## The Dust of Ages
> "I have affixed to me the dirt of countless ages. Who am I to disturb history?"

- The above quote is from Charley Brown, by a character named, "Pig Pen".
- This is also the name of the cipher used in the code.
- You can translate directly from `PigPen` to `English`.
- Alternatively, you can assign all of the symbols in the cipher to a given letter in English, and then treat the cipher like a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher.
- The flag is : ```Passwords should be long, easy to remember, and difficult to guess.```
