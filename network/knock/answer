FLAG: UmTVgYTfOb45

The problem description explains that you are looking for traffic on port 8123. Filter for the two addresses involved in that communication. You will see that initially, traffic on that port was blocked, but after the client makes SYN requests to three un-related ports, he can suddenly access the port. This is termed a secret hand-shake, or more commonly, "Port Knocking" (hence the title, "Who's There?").

Knowing the ports that were knocked, the client can then perform SYN calls at those same ports, and then telnet / ncat / whatever to the port 8123 to request the flag.
